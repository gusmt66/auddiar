A few UI screens for an online audio-sharing and social networking application using Cordova and Ionic. It also includes a Facebook login functionality but it's only available running on an actual Android device. If you want to try it, please compile it for Android using the Ionic comands.

To run the project in a web browser please follow these steps in a CLI:

1) npm update

2) npm install

3) ionic serve

This app only contains UI screens. So the interaction has no much sense, but you can see all the screens by playing around with the Login and Register button, the Tabs and the footer icons.
